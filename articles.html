        <div id="article1" style="display: none">
          <h3>A Lifesaving Journey</h3>
          <p>
            Blood donation, a practice that saves countless lives daily, has a
            rich and fascinating history. This lifesaving procedure, which has
            become a cornerstone of modern medicine, is the result of centuries
            of scientific inquiry, trial and error, and the relentless pursuit
            of knowledge.
          </p>
          <h3>Early Theories and Experiments</h3>
          <p>
            The concept of blood transfusion dates back to ancient times. Early
            civilizations, including the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans,
            recognized blood's vital role in life. However, their understanding
            was limited, and their medical practices often involved mystical and
            spiritual interpretations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 17th century, European scientists began to explore the
            circulatory system more rigorously. William Harvey's groundbreaking
            work, "De Motu Cordis," published in 1628, described the circulation
            of blood, revolutionizing the understanding of the cardiovascular
            system. Harvey's work inspired other scientists to investigate blood
            further, leading to the first attempts at blood transfusion.
          </p>
          <h3>The First Blood Transfusions</h3>
          <p>
            The first recorded blood transfusions were conducted in the 17th
            century. In 1665, an English physician named Richard Lower
            successfully transfused blood between dogs, demonstrating the
            feasibility of the procedure. This experiment marked a significant
            milestone, but it was quickly followed by attempts to transfuse
            blood in humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1667, Jean-Baptiste Denis, a French physician, performed the
            first documented human blood transfusion. Denis transfused sheep's
            blood into a 15-year-old boy suffering from a fever. Remarkably, the
            boy survived the procedure, although the practice was met with
            controversy and skepticism. Denis's subsequent transfusions had
            mixed results, leading to legal challenges and a temporary halt in
            the practice.
          </p>
          <h3>Advances in the 19th Century</h3>
          <p>
            The 19th century saw significant advancements in medical science,
            including the development of anesthesia and antiseptics. These
            innovations created a more conducive environment for surgical
            procedures and blood transfusions. During this time, James Blundell,
            a British obstetrician, emerged as a pioneer in human blood
            transfusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blundell, motivated by the high mortality rate of women during
            childbirth due to hemorrhage, conducted a series of experiments to
            transfuse human blood. Between 1818 and 1829, he performed several
            successful transfusions, using his invention, the "impellor," a
            device designed to transfer blood from the donor to the patient.
            Blundell's work demonstrated the potential of blood transfusion in
            saving lives, particularly in obstetric emergencies.
          </p>
          <h3>The Discovery of Blood Groups</h3>
          <p>
            A significant breakthrough in the history of blood donation occurred
            in the early 20th century with the discovery of blood groups. Karl
            Landsteiner, an Austrian immunologist, identified the major blood
            groups (A, B, AB, and O) in 1901. This discovery was crucial in
            understanding why some blood transfusions were successful while
            others resulted in severe reactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Landsteiner's work laid the foundation for safe blood transfusions,
            as it became clear that compatibility between the donor's and
            recipient's blood was essential. This discovery earned Landsteiner
            the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930 and revolutionized
            the practice of blood transfusion.
          </p>
          <h3>World War I and the Birth of Blood Donation</h3>
          <p>
            The outbreak of World War I in 1914 highlighted the urgent need for
